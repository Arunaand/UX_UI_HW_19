<h1>Rum8: Roommate Finder App Case Study</h1>
<section><h1 class="display-4">My Work!</h1>
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
        <h2></h2>
        <blockquote><b>Executive Summary:</b> As a user researcher, the aim is to comprehend the challenges individuals encounter when planning travels in the post-pandemic era. To accomplish this objective, user tests will be conducted to identify pain points, and based on the affinity diagram and empathy map, a user persona will be created. The design thinking process will then be initiated, which includes the define and ideate phases. This process will be used to create a mobile application that addresses the identified needs. As a UX designer, the task at hand is to research, prototype, test, and validate a brand-new mobile application that solves a real problem that is clearly defined in users' everyday lives. The prototype will need to be iterated and tested for usability issues to ensure that the app meets the users' needs.</blockquote>
        <p><b>Project Overview:</b><br>
            Project Overview: 
            This project was a product design exercise to see if I could solve a problem statement and design it as a mobile experience in a short period.
            <br>
            To solve the stated problem, designing a mobile application that allows users to search for rooms in pre-occupied apartments and potential roommates to share rooms and rent with.

            <b>Problem statement</b>
<blockquote> was established to create opportunities for like-minded individuals to bypass bad roommate situations. We observed that young professionals and college graduates didn’t always strike gold when finding or being assigned roommates. How might we launch ruM8 to increase user satisfaction, increase user registrations, and geometric tracking to help determine future marketing campaigns?</blockquote>

<h3>Research</h3>
<blockquote> starting the user research, I did research to collect data and insights that helped me understand the problem space better and also to get some baseline information in understanding the overall market structure, the industry situation, past consumer trends, and behaviors, and to support & validate insights from primary research. Research process includes Surveys & User feedback are a very important factor but to expedite the process I have managed to research and gone through different websites and mobile apps to understand user base.</blockquote>
<p>Google Form Survey: We performed a survey with 16 participants.</p>
<p>Age: 18+</p>
<blockquote>Some of the questions that were asked:
After gathering my initial research, I had a solid idea of our target market and potential users. However, I needed more first-hand insights to ensure I came up with the right solution. So, I went ahead with user interviews to empathize with the users and understand their needs and wants. We interviewed five users virtually. Prepared a set of questions that I came up with after going around the problem statement a couple of times and doing a short brain-writing session. 
Screen Participants Requirements: Need to have had a college roommate.
Need to be between the Ages of 18-28.
We developed interview questions based on our research question and objectives. </blockquote>
<blockquote> Research question: To determine that young professionals or college students want a tool that saves them the hassle of bad roommates and helps them find compatible ones to save money and headaches.</blockquote>
<h3>Objectives:</h3> 
<blockquote>
Understand what living accommodations users need based on employment or accessibility.
Assess their experience in finding a roommate in the past and understand the thought process behind people’s decisions in choosing their roommate.
Discover how participants felt after their roommate experience.

<ul>
The questions were :
Current location of users?
For how long have they been living there?
What is their current accommodation and how did they find it ?
How much rent are they paying for it ?
Are they satisfied with living in their current accommodation ?
How many accommodations have they changed since they first started living in the city ?
Are they sharing the space with any roommate currently ?
If yes then how did they find the roommate ?
What is an ideal accommodation for them ?
What is an ideal roommate for them ?
Any bad experiences with roommates ?
Hardest part of looking for a room/roommate ?
Are you aware of any platforms on which you can find roommates?
After reviewing the interview answers, we came up with the problem statement, and the affinity diagram.
</ul>

<b>Problem:</b>
<blockquote>
RuM8 was established to create opportunities for like-minded individuals to bypass bad roommate situations. We observed that young professionals and college graduates didn’t always strike gold when finding or being assigned roommates. How might we launch ruM8 to increase user satisfaction, increase user registrations, and use geo-metric tracking to help determine future marketing campaigns?</blockquote>

<br>
<b>Solution:</b> 
<blockquote>
Create a community app that allows young professionals and college students to find roommates they feel will be compatible. </blockquote>
<blockquote>
 Goals that were found:
Understand what living accommodations users need based on employment or accessibility
Assess their experience in finding roommates in the past and understand the thought process behind people’s decisions in choosing their roommates.
Discover how participants felt after their roommate experience
“Good communication and privacy. Levels of cleanliness are an important factor. Being courteous to the people sharing, giving notice when bringing guests, and being mindful of noise levels at late hours.”
To further our understanding, we compared other apps and found a few strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. </blockquote>
<section><blockquote>
Keeping that in mind, we designed an app that goes above and beyond. We selected four direct competitors to observe the existing roommate-seeking and house-sharing platforms: </blockquote>

Insights from competitive analysis:
Roomster, SpareRoom, and Roomi are the perfect platforms to search for roommates, but unfortunately, they are not global.</blockquote>

 back to Kasey, who needs to find accommodation for the upcoming school year. She met a couple of people through a mixer in the common area but has not found anyone she thinks will be a good roommate. A coworker at the vet office mentions RuM8 and tells her to check it out. She creates an account and finds some people she thinks fit well. Sets up a coffee date with one, and they hit it off. She is now moving in next week to her new apartment with Tracy. In doing so, we set out a plan on the hypothetical path from stating the problem to the problem solved while working on the total sequence and refining the details of User Kasey’s journey.</blockquote></section>

<b>User Persona</b>
<blockquote>
To better understand the user behavior and needs, we designed our user persona, Kasey Sanchez, This helped me make clearer and better decisions— focused on user needs and goals.

<section>
<blockquote>
Keeping Kasey in mind, we wanted to assist in her process of finding an app with features and finding a roommate and a room while keeping track of the budget. So, we went on a journey to analyze who our competitors were. Upon review, we sorted them into Direct and Indirect competitors. Out of several competitors, we looked at several apps such as Roomster, Roomies, and Spareroom as Direct Competitors, and Facebook and Craig’s List as InDirect Competitors.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Roomster has been around for some time, allowing users to advertise their rooms. However, they had a paywall feature to use the full app. Roomies created a listing in the nearby area, but it didn’t offer the convenience of a mobile app. Spareroom had the feature of making lists, but it was available only in two countries.</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Keeping all the strengths and weaknesses in mind, we are designing an app that would offer our Users the comfort and confidence to find the roommate and room of their choice on the desired budget. This led us to plan the User Flow to make it effortless and seamless for our Users.</p>

<section>
<h3>Defining user needs</h3>
<p><b>Addressing user needs, pain points & assumptions</b></p>
<blockquote> <b>Pain Points: </b>
Platforms full of broker listings
Fake listings with fake pictures and information
Sharing contact number and address details on platforms
Annoying, ill-mannered roommates
Scarcity of appropriate platforms to look for roommates/flatmates
2. Needs:
Find an ideal accommodation
Find an ideal roommate/flatmate
Privacy protected
Cut down costs of living


3. Assumptions:
Users need a way to explore their potential roommate’s interests, habits, and personality traits
Users want personalized recommendations</blockquote> 
</section>
<h3> Journey map</h3>
<blockquote>
    I used the user persona to create a journey map for the phase intersecting with my product scope. I divided the user’s journey into stages and mapped the touchpoints. I tried finding opportunities for each stage through the users' feelings, thoughts, and activities.
    <img src="images/cs2Feature Prioritization Matrix.png" width="100%" height="auto">
</blockquote> 

<h3>Ideation</h3>
<blockquote>
Before ideating solutions, I created a basic user flow for the product to have a visual representation of the path the user can follow to achieve the goal. We progressed into How Might We’s
Based on the opportunities in the user journey map, I created HMWs that helped me come up with solutions for the problem statement.
HMW minimizes the creation of fake and anonymous profiles on the platform.
HMW recommends matching rooms and roommates to the users.
HMW assists users in finding the best localities.
HMW assists the users in bonding with their flatmates/roommates.</blockquote>
<h3>Sitemap</h3>
<blockquote>
    Created a sitemap that shows the information architecture of the app, to give a visual representation of the different sections in the app and how they are linked together.</blockquote>
    <section>
<h3>Wireframes</h3>
<blockquote>
I made a lot of pen-and-paper sketches to connect the app’s information architecture to its visual design. Wireframing is important because it clarifies consistent ways of displaying particular types of information on the interface. and also determines the intended functionality of the interface.</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Prototype.</h3>
<blockquote>
After all Research, Sketching & Wireframing it will automatically expedite your prototyping process, in my choice of tool I have use Figma for UI designing or prototyping. Please check below final Prototype</blockquote>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Usability Testing</h3>
<blockquote>
Testing the prototype with actual users will give you real feedback. </blockquote>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Next Steps:</h3>
<blockquote>
    We would like to continue building out and implementing features we identified as high impact and high complexity after our first round of usability testing.


The main features we would like to focus on are as follows:
Additional profile sections to focus more on housing preferences
Users will be able to fill out more details on what living situations (types of housing, amenities, etc.) they are looking for
Improving our algorithm to show user profiles that meet a baseline compatibility percentage
Users will quickly understand which areas they are compatible with a person when viewing their profile
Users will not be shown profiles that they are not compatible with
Improving visibility and features of confirmed roommates
We would like to improve the visibility and features highlighting roommates who are confirmed.
We need a way to confirm roommates so they can best utilize the expenses tab
Linking expenses tab with 3rd party payment solutions (Venmo, Zelle, etc.)
Instead of having to manually input expenses in our app, we would like to automate expense tracking so the feature is more convenient to use

After implementing these features, we would like to run another round of usability testing to iterate our app further.</blockquote>
</section>
<b>Conclusion.</b>
<blockquote>
Just believe in yourself & open your mind while research, sketch and create a wireframe. Trust me when you go through these steps you will keep improving your design in every step and at the same time, you will improve your skills. Here in this challenge, I have just used a simple approach and tools which you use every day to make the product design more problem-solving.</blockquote>
